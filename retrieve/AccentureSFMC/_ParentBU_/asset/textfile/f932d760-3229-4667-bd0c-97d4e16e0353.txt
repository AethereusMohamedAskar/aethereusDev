IP Warmup Challenges:

They have bad email history. (No email activity for last six months)
So there is lot of possibilities we may face hard bounces, less CTR percentages and IP will be blacklisted.

FYI, 
Standard Hard Bounce rate is 0.1%  (1 Hard bounce / 1000 emails)
Good to have open rate is 20%


Decisions we took,
Hard Bounce < Open Rate < IP volume scale up (last sent volume * 1.4) 0
