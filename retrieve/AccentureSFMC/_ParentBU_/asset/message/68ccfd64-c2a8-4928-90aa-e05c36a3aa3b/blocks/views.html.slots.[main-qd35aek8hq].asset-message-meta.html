                Different occasions need a different style of bags. There is a thumb rule- smaller
                bags make you look more sophisticated. That&rsquo;s why a clutch should be carried
                with a formal dress, while big bags with a more casual dress. If you ever mistakenly
                carry a big handbag with a party formal attire, you are a murderer of fashion!<br />
                <br />
                Let&rsquo;s get a bag full of knowledge to select your handbag according to the
                occasion:<br />
                <br />
                While going on shopping, an oversized hobo or duffel bag with a casual shirt, pair
                of trousers, or shorts with sneakers or gladiators will give a weekend vibe.<br />
                <br />
                With a more structured look, while wearing skin fit jeans with a tucked shirt and a
                blazer with pumps, you can add a tote, hobo or shoulder bag.<br />
