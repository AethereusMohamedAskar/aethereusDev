                            >The buzz of Quantum Computing is all around us for some time now. While
                            scientists and tech companies are trying to validate Google&rsquo;s
                            claim of Quantum Supremacy, there have been endless efforts from
                            Physicists, Material Scientists and Programmers to make quantum
                            computing a reality. Be it IBM&rsquo;s new 53 qubit quantum computer or
                            Microsoft&rsquo;s Topological Qubit, the tech industry giants are
                            betting big on Quantum Computing and running dedicated quantum computing
                            research departments to develop programmable quantum computers. All this
                            in a hope to move to much more stable and less noisy quantum computers
                            as compared to the current generation of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale
                            Quantum) processors. While the geniuses are hard at work in making
                            practical quantum computing a reality, we at Aethereus started our own
                            quantum computing journey using IBM Quantum Computing and Qiskit
                            framework. Coming from a classical computing background it took some
                            time for us to get our heads around the quantum computing concepts
                            starting from Qubit to superposition and entanglements. After getting
                            through the basics it was time to run some hands-on experiments on
                            quantum computing and here&rsquo;s how we went about it. IBM Quantum
                            Computing and Qiskit &ndash; IBM Q Experience helped us to get our
                            basics right, with the online Circuit Composer and notebooks we were
                            able to try out the circuits and visualize the results online.
