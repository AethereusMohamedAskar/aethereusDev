            Games don't make you violent, lag does. I'm not a player. I'm a gamer. Players get
            chicks. I get achievements. Failure doesn't mean the game is over, it means try again
            with experience. I'm the hero of a thousand stories. I'm a superhero, an assassin a
            soldier. I've slain dragons and traveled through portals. I am a spartan, a commander. A
            king. I've saved a thousand worlds and countless more lives. What am I? I'm a gamer.
