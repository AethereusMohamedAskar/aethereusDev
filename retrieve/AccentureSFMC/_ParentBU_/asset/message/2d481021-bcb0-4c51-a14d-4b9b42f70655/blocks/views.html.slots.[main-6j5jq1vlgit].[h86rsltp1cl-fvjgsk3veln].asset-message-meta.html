                            altered the world around us in many ways. Amidst the changing
                            environment, people have adapted to the new normal by adopting several
                            new behaviors in their daily lives &ndash; be it integrating working
                            from their homes or changing purchasing and entertainment patterns. Here
                            are the key trends of the past year and what it tells us about the road
                            ahead.</span
