            Accenture has not authorized any agency, company or individual to either collect money
            or arrive on any monetary arrangement in exchange for a job at Accenture. Accenture's
            criterion for hiring candidates is merit. Any agency, company or individual offering
            employment with Accenture in exchange for money is misrepresenting their relationship
            with Accenture, which has not authorized any such action. If you are approached by any
            entity or individuals who demand money or any other form of compensation in return for a
            job offer at Accenture - even if they present themselves as representatives or employees
            of Accenture - please send the details to
