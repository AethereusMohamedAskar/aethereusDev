                    tools known as data streams. Data streams facilitate the automatic uploading of
                    data from various sources, as well as the mapping of the source fields to the
                    relevant Datorama fields. For each one of the different data types,
                    there&rsquo;s a dedicated data stream type, sometimes also referred to as a
                    bucket, which is suited for that particular data. &nbsp;</span
