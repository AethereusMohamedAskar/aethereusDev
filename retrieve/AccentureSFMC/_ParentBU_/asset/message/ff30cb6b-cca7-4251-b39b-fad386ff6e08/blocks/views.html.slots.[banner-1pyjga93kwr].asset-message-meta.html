                    Just a quick note on some important news.<br />
                    <br />
                    There has been a major development in America&rsquo;s realization of the
                    importance of Quantum computing.<br />
                    <br />
                    President Joe Biden signed directives on Wednesday, May 4th, 2022 that aim at
                    preparing the U.S for a new era of quantum computing, as Chinese agencies and
                    companies pour billions of dollars into the next-generation technology.<br />
                    <br />
                    Microsoft and company understand how important quantum computing is going to be
                    for the future of cybersecurity and how behind the United States is in this
                    regard. Not so long ago I talked about an important startup in the space called

                    The intersection of Quantum computing and cybersecurity is going to be a big
                    deal. This is especially true if China takes a more aggressive expansionist
                    approach to South-East Asia and Taiwan.<br />
                    <br />
                    So why does this matter to the future of technology, cybersecurity, the U.S.
                    Government and quantum computing&rsquo;s already considerable hype factor? Joe
                    Biden has ordered federal agencies to ramp up preparations for a day when
                    quantum computers are capable of breaking the public-key cryptography currently
                    used to secure digital systems around the world.</span

                    provides for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its

                    What I think this will do is accelerate funding for startups in stealth and pour

                    A.I. in this domain, it seems as if the U.S. Government is finally taking
                    action, although a few years too late and also behind the curve in a significant
                    way. China is easily the first-mover in terms of patents and funding. We just
                    don&rsquo;t know to what extent fully or to what degree.<br />

                    President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed two directives relating to the quantum
                    push - an Executive Order creating the National Quantum Initiative Advisory
                    Committee, as well as a memorandum. Both aim to outline the U.S. priorities' in
                    quantum computing leadership and the hardening of its information systems
                    against <b>quantum-based attacks on its sovereignty.</b><br />
                    <br />
                    Considering how behind the U.S. is in cybersecurity in general, it's a very
                    necessary step, but better late than never.<br />

                        >security memo</a
                    >, released alongside a plan to promote U.S. leadership in quantum computing,
                    directs specific actions for agencies to take during what is being described as
                    a laborious, multi-year process of migrating vulnerable computer systems to
                    quantum-resistant cryptography. I don&rsquo;t know how reassuring it is, but it
                    will fuel Venture Capital to get more hands-on in the space that has exploded in
                    hype since roughly mid-2021.<br />
                    <br />
                    Support for quantum computing research has originated in the U.S. Government
                    probably with the Advanced Scientific Computing Research program in 2017 and
                    then rapidly spread across the Office of Science. I guess rapidly is perhaps not
                    the right term. How just like in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has not taken
                    a very pro-active approach to keep up in the future of technology to date in
                    recent years is most concerning.<br />
                    <br />
                    The U.S. Government needs a better commercialization strategy for its quantum
                    computing sector. Given current market conditions, this is most likely going to
                    come in the form of a winner-takes-all consolidation of Cloud leaders buying out
                    these Quantum computing startups in the form of primarily Microsoft, Amazon AWS,
                    IBM, Google and the like. Few Quantum computing startups will be able to resist
                    the lucrative exits.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>One Government to Rule Them All</b><br />
                    <br />
                    The challenge of the quantum industry isn&rsquo;t ambition; it&rsquo;s scale.
                    Physicists know how to design useful quantum devices. The challenge is building
                    larger devices that scale along with innovative business models. U.S. Government
                    doesn&rsquo;t really understand the ecosystem very well, while China makes very
                    detailed long-term plans for its goals regarding the future of A.I., quantum
                    computing and the various military and National defense applications of the
                    tech.<br />
                    <br />
                    The United States strategy for QIS R&amp;D and related activities is described
                    in the National Strategic Overview for QIS and supplementary documents. I have
                    to say it&rsquo;s not super impressive. I don&rsquo;t know what DARPA, the
                    Pentagon or the Biden Administration is thinking.<br />
                    <br />
                    The gap between China and the U.S.&rsquo;s long term strategy is widening, if
                    anything in the 2020s even while American pundits joke about how unsophisticated
                    the Chinese economy really is amid it's various challenges including its unique
                    approach to the pandemic. The gap between what the economists, technologists and
                    National defense types are saying is truly puzzling and quantum computing as an
                    industry reflects as well.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Biden Administration&rsquo;s commitment to fostering innovation in
                    cutting-edge science and technology while continuing to take the necessary steps
                    to safeguard the economy and infrastructure of the future, is at least now
                    apparently on the front burner, and it's interesting to finally see a commitment
                    and actions like we are seeing in May, 2022.<br />

                    technologies (blockchain). If this occurs it will represent a Quantum

                To kick start the process, the government said the National Security Agency (NSA)
                and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will develop and publish
                new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards that can protect against these future
                attacks. Good luck on this, even Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t been able to fully protect
                us thus far. China continues its rampant corporate espionage outwitting the U.S.<br />
                <br />
                Anyways from a National Security perspective that&rsquo;s the gist of it. The Budget
                is not incredible, but at least it&rsquo;s increasing.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Why It Matters</b><br />
                <br />
                The U.S. is basically setting a chain of events in motion which means Quantum
                Computing will be front in center in the A.I. arms race. The confluence of talented
                physicists, engineers and business leaders tackling the problem is reason for much
                confidence. More private investors are placing bets on the technology.<br />
                <br />
                This means Quantum computing startups will have a vastly inflated value as the
                talent bottleneck is real for the right kind of PhDs. This will mean there will be a
                global explosion of QC related startups that will make the Web3 hype look
                amateurish. The crypto ecosystems since 2009 have still
                <b>consistently failed to show real scalability </b>in their systems.<br />
                <br />
                The Whitehouse smugly notes that Biden, this President&rsquo;s at least, has a
                conviction that cybersecurity and technological innovation are not in conflict but
                rather are complementary and essential to the success of one another. There may be
                no better illustration of this balancing act than in the field of quantum
                information science and technology. I find that hilarious. A 79 year old President
                finally has some advisors that he actually listens to.<br />
                The EO (Executive Order) places the advisory committee directly under the authority
                of the White House, ensuring that the President, Congress, Federal departments and
                agencies, and the general public receive the most current, accurate, and relevant
                information on quantum information science and technology to drive forward U.S.
                policymaking and advance our technological edge. I hope you are right!<br />
