                            decisions, it's easy to forget that eventually, it's going to be a human
                            who'll be making the final choice. For brands to be not just successful
                            but meaningful over time, they will have to account for the combination
                            of contexts (global x external x internal) that their consumers are in.
                            They will also need to consider the rational and emotional decision
                            factors and the evolving heuristics consumers use to make these
                            decisions.&nbsp;</span
