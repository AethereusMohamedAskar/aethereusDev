                    Different occasions need a different style of bags. There is a thumb rule-
                    smaller bags make you look more sophisticated. That&rsquo;s why a clutch should
                    be carried with a formal dress, while big bags with a more casual dress. If you
                    ever mistakenly carry a big handbag with a party formal attire, you are a
                    murderer of fashion!

                    While going on shopping, an oversized hobo or duffel bag with a casual shirt,
                    pair of trousers, or shorts with sneakers or gladiators will give a weekend
                    vibe.

                    With a more structured look, while wearing skin fit jeans with a tucked shirt
                    and a blazer with pumps, you can add a tote, hobo or shoulder bag.
