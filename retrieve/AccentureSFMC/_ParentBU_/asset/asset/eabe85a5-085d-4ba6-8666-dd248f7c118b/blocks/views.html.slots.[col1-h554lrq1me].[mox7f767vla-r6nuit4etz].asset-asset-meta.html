                    IMS, the pioneer in the test preparation industry, has been training and
                    mentoring students for more than four decades for various entrance exams of
                    postgraduate and undergraduate studies in India and abroad.

                    With 14 centers in Mumbai, no student is too far from an IMS center, each of
                    which is located at a walking distance from major metro stations or bus stops.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All our centers are equipped with adequate classrooms, computer labs, and
                    libraries. Students are encouraged to use classroom facilities for group-study
                    and labs for taking online tests.
                </p>

                    IMS philosophy takes us beyond teaching, and focuses on mentoring students to
                    help achieve their career goals. Our mentors help students set their career
                    aspirations, shortlist institutes/programs that meet their aspirations and
                    continuously guide them on the path to achieve success.

                    In response to the constraints imposed by the lockdown due to COVID-19, IMS
                    emerged as a pioneer in the field of online CLAT preparation. IMS successfully
                    modified the entire CLAT program to be delivered online via IMS LIVE platform,
                    specifically designed to deliver live, online classes. The legacy of being the
                    best CLAT coaching institute has continued into the online delivery space, with
                    IMS having established itself well in the online CLAT coaching space also.
