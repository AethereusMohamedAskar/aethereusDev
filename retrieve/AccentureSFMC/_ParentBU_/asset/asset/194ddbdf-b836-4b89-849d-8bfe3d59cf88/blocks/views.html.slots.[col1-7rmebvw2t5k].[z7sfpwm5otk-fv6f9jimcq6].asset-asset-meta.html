                >IMS, the pioneer in the test preparation industry, has been training and mentoring
                students for more than four decades for various entrance exams of postgraduate and
                undergraduate studies in India and abroad.<br />
                <br />
                With 14 centers in Mumbai, no student is too far from an IMS center, each of which
                is located at a walking distance from major metro stations or bus stops.<br />
                <br />
                All our centers are equipped with adequate classrooms, computer labs, and libraries.
                Students are encouraged to use classroom facilities for group-study and labs for
                taking online tests.<br />
                <br />
                IMS philosophy takes us beyond teaching, and focuses on mentoring students to help
                achieve their career goals. Our mentors help students set their career aspirations,
                shortlist institutes/programs that meet their aspirations and continuously guide
                them on the path to achieve success.<br />
                <br />
                In response to the constraints imposed by the lockdown due to COVID-19, IMS emerged
                as a pioneer in the field of online CLAT preparation. IMS successfully modified the
                entire CLAT program to be delivered online via IMS LIVE platform, specifically
                designed to deliver live, online classes. The legacy of being the best CLAT coaching
                institute has continued into the online delivery space, with IMS having established
                itself well in the online CLAT coaching space also.</span
