                        Institute and Daksh Sir and other faculty members(aashima Mam, Vaibhav Sir,
                        Dhaval Sir, Krishma Maâ€™am) Who accepted me into the IMS family. These two
                        years was a golden period of my life because while I was preparing for CLAT
                        I made new friends, besides gaining theoretical knowledge my mentors
                        imparted me with the practical knowledge of the subject in a deep sense they
                        believed in me, guided me through tough situations and they gave me the
                        confidence that I can excel in my career if I put in efforts. I truly feel
                        blessed to be a student of IMS.</span
