                When borrowers default on their loans, banks lose not only the principal sum and
                interest, it has an adverse effect on the cash flow as well. Higher number of
                defaults or delinquent loans lead to low credit scores. It&rsquo;s also a major
                barrier to revenue growth and brings banks under regulatory scrutiny.
