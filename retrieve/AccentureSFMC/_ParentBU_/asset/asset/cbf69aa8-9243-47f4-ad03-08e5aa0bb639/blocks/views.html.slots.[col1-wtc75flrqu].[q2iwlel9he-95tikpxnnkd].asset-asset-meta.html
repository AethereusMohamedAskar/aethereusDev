                                I will always be grateful to my dad who got me admitted to the best
                                Institute and Daksh Sir and other faculty members(aashima Mam,
                                Vaibhav Sir, Dhaval Sir, Krishma Maâ€™am) Who accepted me into the IMS
                                family. These two years was a golden period of my life because while
                                I was preparing for CLAT I made new friends, besides gaining
                                theoretical knowledge my mentors imparted me with the practical
                                knowledge of the subject in a deep sense they believed in me, guided
                                me through tough situations and they gave me the confidence that I
                                can excel in my career if I put in efforts. I truly feel blessed to
                                be a student of IMS.
