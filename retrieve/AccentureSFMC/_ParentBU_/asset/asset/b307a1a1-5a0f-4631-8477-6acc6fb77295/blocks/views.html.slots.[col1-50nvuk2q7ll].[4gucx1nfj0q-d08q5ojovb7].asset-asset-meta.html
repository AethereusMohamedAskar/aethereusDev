                        Salesforce User Sync is the best and simplest way to manage Pardot user
                        access. This feature transfers Pardot user management to Salesforce, and
                        lets you add or remove Pardot users from Marketing Setup.<br />
                        <br />
                        Important: The process for User Sync setup varies depending on when your
                        business unit was created and if you currently use the legacy version. To
                        make sure you&rsquo;re following the correct instructions, see Find the
                        Right User Sync Documentation.<br />

                        If Salesforce User Sync was enabled in your account before July 20, 2020,
                        there are some important things to know before moving to the latest
                        version.<br />
